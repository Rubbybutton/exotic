* Origin
Today I bound a global shortkey for configuring =deepin-screenshot= and =picgo-core= but somehow it crashed though it works well in my terminal.I don't know why,and it's my =fish= / =bash= script.
#+begin_src fish
deepin-screenshot -s /tmp/screenshot.png -n
picgo u /tmp/screenshot.png > /tmp/screenshot.txt
tail -n 1 /tmp/screenshot.txt | xargs echo -n | xclip -selection clipboard # for that picgo's plugin autocopy would add line break
notify-send -a screenshot_uploader -u low "screenshot has been uploaded,and link is copyed" # need to install libnotify
#+end_src
* Hack
For sure where errors occured,I have used =2>file= . e.g.
#+begin_src bash
picgo u /tmp//screenshot.png 2> /tmp/error.txt
#+end_src
* Trouble Shotting
kde global shortkey bending for =command= or =url= not support symbol file,though you use a =bash= client or the other client(such as =fish= , =python= ...) to execute it.
So next time I will be even more cautious about it.
* Solution
#+begin_quote
I only changed the second line
#+end_quote

#+begin_src fish
deepin-screenshot -s /tmp/screenshot.png -n
/home/zarkli/.nvm/versions/node/v16.6.0/bin/node /home/zarkli/.nvm/versions/node/v16.6.0/lib/node_modules/picgo/bin/picgo u /tmp/screenshot.png > /tmp/screenshot.txt
tail -n 1 /tmp/screenshot.txt | xargs echo -n | xclip -selection clipboard # for that picgo's plugin autocopy would add line break
notify-send -a screenshot_uploader -u low "screenshot has been uploaded,and link is copyed" # need to install libnotify
#+end_src
